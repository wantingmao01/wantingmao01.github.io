## About Me
I’m a fourth-year undergrad at UC San Diego pursuing B.S. degrees in Data Science and Mathematics(Applied). I’m curious about Machine Learning, Mathematics, and Theoretical Computer Science as well as the application of those fields, but I'm also willing and hoping to explore many other fields in CS, DS and Mathematics. I am looking forward to gaining more about these areas from my undergrad education and beyond. My ultimate goal is to create a safer, happier, and more equitable world with all my knowledge. Borrowing the slogan of Bayer, my motto is
>Science for a Better Life


## Research Experience
1. [**Implementation of Distribution Testing Algorithms**](https://github.com/wujjohn/Implementation-of-Distribution-Testing-Algorithms) with Professor [Daniel M. Kane](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dakane/)
   - _September 2021 - Present_
   - Volunteer Undergraduate Researcher at Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP)
   - Collaborating with [Aoxi Li](https://github.com/aoxil), [Juyoung Park](https://github.com/jup023), and [John Wu](https://github.com/wujjohn), I implement recent algorithms in distribution testings, test the algorithms' efficiency, and determine whether the theoretical expectations match the experimental outcome.[More about this project.](https://github.com/wujjohn/Implementation-of-Distribution-Testing-Algorithms)

2. **From Theory to Pixels: Diffusion Models for Image and Data Generation** with Professor [Alex Cloninger](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~acloninger/index.html) and Professor [Rayan Saab](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~rsaab/)
  - _Start in September 2023_
  - Data Science major capstone project. During the fall quarter, we will delve into the topic of Diffusion Models, and in winter, we'll develop our own project upon our exploration.
   
3. **Volunteer Undergraduate Researcher at UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering** with Professor [Imani N. S. Munyaka](https://www.imanimunyaka.com/)
    - _September 2022 - December 2022 and March 2023 - June 2023_
    - Explored SAUR Conversational Recommender System, Saleforce Converse and RASA framework for conversational chatbot.
    - Developed Recommendation AI Chatbot for security softwares, including the design of icon and UI.
      
4. [**CSNext: Graduate School Prep Workshop at UW Reality Lab**](https://realitylab.uw.edu/components/csnext.html) with [Shirley Xue](https://xueqiuyue.com) and [Antonio Glenn](https://antoniog.page)
    - _March 2023 - May 2023_
    - Processed ECG signal data collected by smart earrings.
    - Employed ML techniques(Adaboost decision tree, 1D-CNN etc.) to identify abnormal ECG signals with scikit-learn and Tensorflow keras.
    
5. **Student Researcher at UC San Diego Jacobs School of Engineering** with Professor [Imani N. S. Munyaka](https://www.imanimunyaka.com/)
   - _June 2022 - September 2022_
   - Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP) Summer Program
   - Worked on project of building recommendation chatbot for security-related softwares and further explored how the chatbot influences users' model model. [More about this project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tVnZK06rlR5YoPayzCYYr4HqEn6LoroF/view).
   - Twitter analysis including Data Gathering, Data Preprocessing, Keyword Trend Analysis, Sentiment Analysis, and Topic Modeling in both R and Python. [More about this project.](https://github.com/Munyaka-Research-Group/su22_allprojects/tree/main/twitterFU)
      - Individually analyzed 2300+ tweets mentioning “spam call”-related keywords and tags.
      - Assisted team members([Akshay Mehta](https://github.com/Akshay024), [Claire Lee](https://github.com/clairecgl) and [Xinyi(Cindy) Wang](https://github.com/xiw013)) analyze a total of 10000+ tweets.
      - Mentored high school students on the project.
        
    
## Projects
1. [Dress Recommendation Chatbot](https://github.com/wantingmao01/dress_recommendation-chatbot)
   - In collaboration with [Xinyi(Cindy) Wang](https://github.com/xiw013), we created a simple chatbot that recommends dresses for users.
     
2. [Auto login tool for amazon.com](https://github.com/wantingmao01/amazon_auto_signin)
   - A script that helps users log into amazon.com automatically.
     
3. [Rotten Tomato Movie Score Visualization](https://wantingmao01.github.io/Rotten_Tomato_Score_Visualization/)
   - A Visualization of an analysis on Rotten Tomato scores.
   - With the help of JavaSript D3, HTML, and CSS, this project explores what elements make a good movies.
   - This visualization consists three plots with interaction, including scatter plot, geometric plot, and network plot.
     
4. Analysis of US House Representatives Stock Trade
   - With Zhengyun Nie(znie@ucsd.edu), we analyzed the stock trades of the US House of Representatives.
   - This project is consisted of two parts:
        - [Data Propocessing & Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14XIbCWtjVlDM1YcvXpve81b4yOQQz_nF/view?usp=sharing):
          We cleaned the data, explored the data through univariate and bivariate anlysis as well as aggregation, assessed the missingness of one of the columns, and conducted a hypothesis test on whether the trades are evenly distributed on each weekday.
        - [ML classifier](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u91zqX1ucOdzAyfDEK5yosQAGJ3ZTZb_/view?usp=sharing):
          Using the clean data we obtained from the previous analysis, we built up a decision tree classifier model which predicts whether a transaction if purchare or sale given 12 features with ≈ 68 percent accurracy. Moreover, we analzed the fairness of our model with respect to the titles of different representatives.
5. [Weather Bot](https://github.com/wantingmao01/Weather_bot)
   - A practice of Rasa following a [tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/chatbots-using-python-and-rasa/).
