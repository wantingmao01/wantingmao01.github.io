## About Me
I'm a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, advised by Prof. [Jim Rehg](https://rehg.org). My interest lies in artificial intelligence for healthcare, with a current emphasis on self-supervised learning methods for analyzing time-series data. My ultimate goal is to create a safer, happier, and more equitable world with all my knowledge. Borrowing the slogan of Bayer, my motto is
>Science for a Better Life

## Undergrad Research Experience
1. [**Implementation of Distribution Testing Algorithms**](https://github.com/wujjohn/Implementation-of-Distribution-Testing-Algorithms) with Professor [Daniel M. Kane](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dakane/)
   - _September 2021 - June 2024_
   - Volunteer Undergraduate Researcher at Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP)
   - [Repo](https://github.com/wujjohn/Implementation-of-Distribution-Testing-Algorithms)

2. [**From Theory to Pixels: Diffusion Models for Image and Data Generation**] with Professor [Alex Cloninger](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~acloninger/index.html) and Professor [Rayan Saab](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~rsaab/)
   - _September 2023 - March 2024_

3. **High-fidelity Customized Scene/Character Video Generation**
   - _Januaray 2024 - August 2024_
   - Tencent Games Engine Technology Salon, Rocket Plan
   - Current generative models are widely used in image and video generation, however, the results usually cannot achieve high-fidelity as expected. We want to study algorithms that generate high-fidelity video with customized characters or scenes from the perspective of image dynamics.
