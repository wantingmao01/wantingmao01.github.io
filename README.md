## About Me
I'm a third year undergrad at UC San Diego pursuing Bachelor of Science in both Data Science and Mathematics(Applied). I'm curious about Machine Learning, NLP, Mathematics as well as theoretical computer science and am looking forward to gaining more about these areas from my undergrad education and beyond. My ultimate goal is to create a safer, happier, and more equitable world with all my knowledge. Borrowing the slogan of Bayer, my motto is
>Science for a Better Life



## Research Experience

1. **Undergrad Research Assistant at SEISUP Lab** with [Professor Imani N. S. Munyaka](https://www.imanimunyaka.com/)

_June 2022 - Present_

Working on projects of building bot to gather data with emphasize on password security from multiple websites and designing AI chatbot that gives security advices.

-[mini project -- Recommendation chatbot](https://github.com/wantingmao01/dress_recommendation-chatbot): In collaboration with [Cindy Wang](xiw013@ucsd.edu), we created a simple chatbot that recommends dresses for users.

-[mini project -- Auto login tool for amazon.com](https://github.com/wantingmao01/amazon_auto_signin): a script that helps users log into amazon.com automatically.


2. **Implement Distribution Testing Algorithms** with [Professor Daniel M. Kane](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dakane/)

_September 2021 - Present_

Collaboring with [Aoxi Li](aoli@ucsd.edu), [Juyoung Park](jup023@ucsd.edu), and [John Wu](jjw004@ucsd.edu), I implemented recent algorithms in distribution testings, test the algorithms' efficiency, and determine whether the theoretical expectations match the experimental outcome.
