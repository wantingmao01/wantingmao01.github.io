## About Me
I’m a fourth-year undergrad at UC San Diego pursuing B.S. degrees in Data Science and Mathematics(Applied). I’m curious about Machine Learning models and their applications in inverse problems, vison, science, and many other fields, but I'm also willing and hoping to explore many other fields in CS, DS and Mathematics. I am looking forward to gaining more about these areas from my undergrad education and beyond. My ultimate goal is to create a safer, happier, and more equitable world with all my knowledge. Borrowing the slogan of Bayer, my motto is
>Science for a Better Life


## Research Experience
1. [**Implementation of Distribution Testing Algorithms**](https://github.com/wujjohn/Implementation-of-Distribution-Testing-Algorithms) with Professor [Daniel M. Kane](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~dakane/)
   - _September 2021 - Present_
   - Volunteer Undergraduate Researcher at Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP)
   - Collaborating with [Aoxi Li](https://github.com/aoxil), [Juyoung Park](https://github.com/jup023), and [John Wu](https://github.com/wujjohn), I implement recent algorithms in distribution testings, test the algorithms' efficiency, and determine whether the theoretical expectations match the experimental outcome. [Repo](https://github.com/wujjohn/Implementation-of-Distribution-Testing-Algorithms)

2. **From Theory to Pixels: Diffusion Models for Image and Data Generation** with Professor [Alex Cloninger](https://ccom.ucsd.edu/~acloninger/index.html) and Professor [Rayan Saab](https://mathweb.ucsd.edu/~rsaab/)
   - _September 2023 - Present_
   - Data Science major capstone project.
   - Explored limitations of diffusion model in reconstrusting the exact distributions. Also, investigated on it's inability to reconstruct multiple distributions. Those findings provide understanding into the theoretical reasons behind generating the out-of-distribution data points.
   - Starting next quarter, we'll dive into the application of diffusion model in inverse problems. Inspired by this cool [project](https://medium.com/@ruoshi.liu/shadows-shed-light-on-3d-objects-6cf475cbc840), we want to reconstruct 3D objects based on their shadows with diffusion-based generative model. Furthermore, we'd like to study means to leverage prediction accuracy with more information and deal with senarios in the case of multiple objects. If time permits, we plan to apply our outcomes to reconstruct buildings from satellite images.
   
3. **The Impact of Security-Related Chatbots on Users’ Mental Model** with Professor [Imani N. S. Munyaka](https://www.imanimunyaka.com/)
    - _September 2022 - December 2022 and March 2023 - June 2023_
    - Admitted as part of the ERSP summer program.
    - Background: Although recommendation chatbots are commonly used, we want to assess the influence of a security-focused chatbot on user mental frameworks and the overall user experience.
    - Explored SAUR Conversational Recommender System, Saleforce Converse and Rasa framework for conversational chatbot.
    - Developed Recommendation AI Chatbot for security softwares, including the design of icon and UI. [Slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tVnZK06rlR5YoPayzCYYr4HqEn6LoroF/view), [Talk](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10Hf-54o2aWcD0c1wKaCTqPY2S1R-Upg1/view?usp=drive_link)
      
4. [**CSNext: Graduate School Prep Workshop at UW Reality Lab**](https://realitylab.uw.edu/components/csnext.html) with [Shirley Xue](https://xueqiuyue.com) and [Antonio Glenn](https://antoniog.page)
    - _March 2023 - May 2023_
    - Selected to be part of the UW CSnext workshop.
    - Processed ECG signal data collected by smart earrings.
    - Employed ML techniques(Adaboost decision tree, 1D-CNN etc.) to identify abnormal ECG signals with scikit-learn and Tensorflow keras.[Slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1gANPhlKGhzyfjHVtH1_s1UDwlTLk4VhuGtrWEP0PTjY/edit?usp=sharing)
    
5. **Tweeter Data Analysis** with Professor [Imani N. S. Munyaka](https://www.imanimunyaka.com/)
   - _June 2022 - September 2022_
   - Early Research Scholars Program (ERSP) Summer Program
   - Twitter analysis including Data Gathering, Data Preprocessing, Keyword Trend Analysis, Sentiment Analysis, and Topic Modeling in both R and Python.
      - Individually analyzed 2300+ tweets mentioning “spam call”-related keywords and tags.
      - Assisted team members([Akshay Mehta](https://github.com/Akshay024), [Claire Lee](https://github.com/clairecgl) and [Xinyi(Cindy) Wang](https://github.com/xiw013)) analyze a total of 10000+ tweets.
      - Mentored high school students on the project.
        
    
## Projects
1. [Dress Recommendation Chatbot](https://github.com/wantingmao01/dress_recommendation-chatbot)
   - In collaboration with [Xinyi(Cindy) Wang](https://github.com/xiw013), we created a simple chatbot that recommends dresses for users.
     
2. [Auto login tool for amazon.com](https://github.com/wantingmao01/amazon_auto_signin)
   - A script that helps users log into amazon.com automatically.
     
3. [Rotten Tomato Movie Score Visualization](https://wantingmao01.github.io/Rotten_Tomato_Score_Visualization/)
   - This is the final project of the DSC106 @UCSD instructed by Professor Soohyun Nam Liao during Spring 2023. [Git repo](https://github.com/wantingmao01/Rotten_Tomato_Score_Visualization)
   - With the help of JavaSript D3, HTML, and CSS, this project explores what elements make a good movies.
   - This visualization consists three plots with interaction, including scatter plot, geometric plot, and network plot.
     
4. Analysis of US House Representatives Stock Trade
   - This is a project assignment from DSC 80 @UCSD instructed by Professor Justin Eldridge during Fall 2022.
   - With Zhengyun Nie(znie@ucsd.edu), we analyzed the stock trades of the US House of Representatives.
   - This project is consisted of two parts:
        - [Data Propocessing & Analysis](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14XIbCWtjVlDM1YcvXpve81b4yOQQz_nF/view?usp=sharing): We cleaned the data, explored the data through univariate and bivariate anlysis as well as aggregation, assessed the missingness of one of the columns, and conducted a hypothesis test on whether trades are evenly distributed on each weekday.
        - [ML classifier](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u91zqX1ucOdzAyfDEK5yosQAGJ3ZTZb_/view?usp=sharing): Using the clean data we obtained from the previous analysis, we built up a decision tree classifier model which predicts whether a transaction if purchare or sale given 12 features with ≈ 68 percent accurracy. Moreover, we analzed the fairness of our model with respect to the titles of different representatives.
          
5. [Weather Bot](https://github.com/wantingmao01/Weather_bot)
   - A practice of Rasa following a [tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/chatbots-using-python-and-rasa/).
