## About Me
I’m a third-year undergrad at UC San Diego pursuing B.S. degrees in Data Science and Mathematics(Applied). I’m curious about Machine Learning, , Mathematics, and Theoretical Computer Science as well as the application of those fields, but I'm also willing and hoping to explore many other fields in CS, DS and Mathematics. I am looking forward to gaining more about these areas from my undergrad education and beyond. My ultimate goal is to create a safer, happier, and more equitable world with all my knowledge. Borrowing the slogan of Bayer, my motto is
>Science for a Better Life
